			<h3>Why do I need a username and password to use ILLiad?</h3>

			<p>Your username and password allows us to give you secure access to information about
			your interlibrary loan requests. We can also enable you to edit your personal information
			such as your address or phone number. </p>

			<p>Your username can be anything you like, such as your name, abbreviations, or an
			alphanumeric code. Your password also can be anything you like. We recommend that you
			follow good security practice and choose a password that is different from those you use
			to access other systems. However, no one but you will know your password, not even the
			library staff. The password you set is stored in an encrypted file.</p>

			<h3>Why don't I see all my older requests when I look at my request history?</h3>

			<p>From time to time we purge older records from ILLiad. Our policy is to keep
			requests online for several years order to comply with record keeping requirements
			of the copyright law.</p>

			<h3>What is electronic delivery?</h3>

			<p>Many libraries ship photocopies of articles to us in electronic format. In the past we
			printed these articles before delivering them to you. Now, through ILLiad, we are able to
			offer you the option of electronic delivery of these articles in PDF format (Adobe's
			Portable Document Format). You can read more about electronic delivery on the <a href="ElectronicDeliveryInformation.html">Electronic Delivery
			Information</a> page.</p>
