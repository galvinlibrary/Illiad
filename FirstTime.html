          <p>WARNING CONCERNING COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS<br />
            The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) 
            governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted 
            materials.<br />
            Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives 
            are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of 
            these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is 
            not to be &quot;used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, 
            or research&quot;. If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a 
            photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of &quot;fair use&quot;, 
            that user may be liable for copyright infringement.<br />
            This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying
